# DnD Stat Machine

## Overview
DnD Stat Machine is a C++ application designed to streamline Dungeons & Dragons character creation and stat generation. The project leverages **Dear ImGui** for a user-friendly graphical interface and **Vulkan** for rendering. It provides an intuitive way to roll dice, assign attributes, and manage character data efficiently.

_This project is still in early development._


## Features
- **Dice Rolling System** – Implements various D&D dice mechanics via `dice.h` and `dice.cpp`.
- **Character Stat Management** – Future integration of race/class-based stats from JSON files.
- **Graphical User Interface** – Utilizes Dear ImGui for interactive stat allocation and customization.
- **Modular Design** – Structured with a dedicated `imgui/` directory for UI components and `src/` for core logic.

## Project Structure
- **`imgui/`** – Contains the Dear ImGui source files for UI implementation.
- **`src/`** – Houses the main application logic, including:
  - `main.cpp` – Entry point of the application.
  - `dice.h` / `dice.cpp` – Handles D&D dice mechanics.
  - `character.h` / `character.cpp` - Handles D&D character mechanics
- **Planned JSON Integration** – Future development will add JSON support for race-based stat bonuses.

## Future Enhancements
- **Race & Class Selection** – Implement a JSON-based system for dynamically loading race and class data.
- **Save & Load Character Data** – Enable saving character builds in a structured format.
- **Expanded UI Features** – Add graphical elements for better visualization of stats and dice rolls.
